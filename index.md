# Bill and Heathers 60th Anniversary Video
## Sssshhhh .... It’s a surprise!

To celebrate Bill and Heather’s 60th Wedding Anniversary, we would very much like to throw the party of all parties to celebrate this wonderful day. 

However, at this time, it will not be something that is possible.

As such, we have decided to give them a surprise and put together a video from all their Family and Friends expressing their wishes of love and friendship.
If this is something that you would like to be involved in, we are asking for you to record a short video (maximum of 2 minutes long) and send it in to us so we can edit them together into one special video that will be presented to them on their special day so they can watch it in the comfort of their own home.

Using your mobile phone should be sufficient and then you can upload it to the link below. You should be able to click on the link directly on your mobile phone and then select the video clip. Alternatively, you can scan the QR code below to access the website:

If you need any help with uploading your video, please email [video@ekto.uk](mailto:video@ekto.uk)

Can we please ask that we have all of your videos by **Monday 5th April 2021** to allow us time to put these together. 

We hope to upload the video online to a private link once the video has been presented to Bill and Heather. If anyone has any objections, please let me know. We will share the link to all those involved.
